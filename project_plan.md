##  Considerations 

---

- <span style="color:red"> Live feed from thermal camera </span>
	- Is input Analog/Digital? ADC (hardware/software) might be required
	- If digital input is acquired, then tapping into the correct port using Python/C will be required
- Detectron/EfficientDet based object detection code. Pull from GitHub
- Labelling and training of the detector engine
- <span style="color:red"> Acquiring dataset  of training images </span>
- <span style="color:red"> Fabrication of the Proof of Concept </span>
	- portable platform for hosting the code and interfacing with the image capture device
	- Funds and procurement
